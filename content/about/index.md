I'm a third-year undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics. 
I enjoy building out scalable solutions to important `computational` problems. I'm actively looking for challenging and impactful internship opportunities for the spring, summer, and fall of 2021.
In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, becoming a better salsa + bachata dancer, and cooking to upbeat music.
